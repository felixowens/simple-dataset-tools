## Improvements

### TASK001

- Add pre-export jobs:
  - Export images as png for datasets (enabled by default)
  - Add resizing options

### TASK002

- Add option to fork dataset, or similar for iterating and creating the next version of the dataset with additional images.

### TASK003

- When selecting images, sort by most similar using the `PHash`.

### TASK004

- During upload stage, make uploads idempotent, so we cannot upload the same image multiple times.
- Allow deleting images from the dataset.
